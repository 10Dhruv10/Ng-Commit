This Repo has various different Angular projects made for the purpose of learning Angular.

## Projects

### 01-starting-project
A basic task management application made while exploring various Angular functionalities like:
- **Standalone components** and modern Angular architecture
- **Component communication** using @Input and @Output decorators
- **Services and dependency injection** for shared state management
- **Two-way data binding** with FormsModule
- **Event handling** and user interactions
- **Dynamic rendering** with structural directives
- **Component composition** and content projection with `<ng-content>`

### 02-modules
A module-based version of the task management app, exploring:
- **NgModule architecture** instead of standalone components
- **Module declarations, imports, and exports**
- **Lazy loading** capabilities (main advantage of modules over standalone components)
- **Shared modules** for reusable components across the application
- **Module-based bootstrapping** using `bootstrapModule` instead of `bootstrapApplication`
- Converting standalone components to module-based architecture
